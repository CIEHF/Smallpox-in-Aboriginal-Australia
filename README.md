## Abstract
The impact of smallpox (variola) on Aboriginal peoples of Australia in 1789 was catastrophic and irreversible. Historically biased perspectives of the disease’s introduction and spread impede modern-day reconciliation efforts. Understanding whether the disease entered and spread from pre-colonial Makassan (Indonesian) trade along the north coast, or from the First Fleet’s arrival in south-eastern Australia is necessary to infer the likely rate of spread and magnitude of mortality. We developed stochastic, multi-patch epidemiological models, supported by historical observations of the disease, to test hypotheses regarding possible entry points, spread rate, and demographic impacts. Our models suggest that entry from south-eastern Australia was more likely, with a probability < 0.02 of reaching Sydney from a northern entry, and an unrealistic chronology. The spread of the disease was rapid, and suggests a single interaction could have resulted in the widespread impacts of the disease. Initial entry to extinction of the disease took between 1,200 and 1,400 days (< 4 years), and due to its high mortality rate, appears to have been limited to the eastern margins of Australia and along major intersecting river systems. There was a lower likelihood of transmission into semi-arid, arid, or tropical areas. We found no evidence that smallpox would have reached the central or western half of Australia. Assuming a 60% lethality based on global data, the loss of > 150,000 people would have occurred in these regions in < 4 years, more than previously proposed, but in alignment with recent projections of demographic change during that period.
