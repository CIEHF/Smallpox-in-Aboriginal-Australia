## Abstract
The impact of smallpox (variola) on Aboriginal communities in Australia beginning in 1789 was catastrophic and continues to cause intergenerational trauma. Historically biased perspectives and contemporary misinformation of the disease’s introduction and spread impede modern-day truth-telling and subsequent reconciliation and national healing. Understanding whether the disease entered and spread from pre-colonial Makassan (Indonesian) trade along the northern coast, or from the First Fleet’s arrival in south-eastern Australia in 1788, is necessary to estimate demographic impact. We developed stochastic, multi-patch epidemiological models supported by systematic evaluation of historical observations to test hypotheses regarding possible disease entry points, spread rate, and demographic impacts. Our models confirm that entry of the disease was in south-eastern Australia. Even under ideal conditions and with higher-than-probable infection rates, simulations show that smallpox was unlikely to reach Sydney from a northern entry. Due to a high mortality rate, the epidemic appears to have been limited to the south-eastern coastal margins of Australia and along major intersecting river systems such as the Murray and Lachlan Rivers. There is no evidence that the 1789 epidemic was Australia-wide. Assuming a 60\% lethality based on global data, the loss of 40,000–240,000 people would have occurred in these regions. While catastrophic to traditional Indigenous lifeways in the southeast, the disease also provided the catalyst for population decline and marginalisation of Indigenous people in the face of expanding European populations. It seems unlikely that other parts of Australia were affected by the initial epidemic, and we recommend revisiting previous assumptions of the subsequent impacts to Indigenous societies by other diseases and frontier violence. We warn readers that the content of this study is confronting and possibly distressing.

- main script: <code>OneStage.m</code>

### Functions within main script
- <code>Movement.m</code>: simulates movement between neighbouring patches
- <code>Spread.m</code>: simulates disease spread through contact within each patch (susceptible to exposed S → E)
- <code>adaptive_tau.m</code>: adaptively chooses tau for tau-leap that optimizes spread (within Spread.m function)
- <code>RecoverDeath.m</code>: simulates the other stages of the disease (exposed to infected E → I, and infected to recovered I → R)
- <code>Middle.m</code>: simplified global model (no age structure, 4 disease stages, 1 infectious stage)
- <code>Full_Model.m</code>: simplified global model (sets parameters and initial conditions)

- <em>Population_Estimate.mat</em>: projected population vector for each patch (1×592)
- <em>Q_Estimate.mat</em>: conditional probability of movement to each neighbouring patch (∑ for each patch = 1).  
- <em>Tindale.mat</em>: area for each patch based on <a href="https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/catalog/2753275">Tindale (1974)</a> map
