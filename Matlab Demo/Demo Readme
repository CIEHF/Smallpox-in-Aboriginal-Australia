Small_Example.m is a small demo that includes only 4 patches corresponding to patches 512,518,523 and 527 in the full model.

Run the main program "Small_Example.m" in MATLAB.

The main program calls "Middle_Example".
Middle_Example calls on Spread, RecoverDeath and Movement.

Data Files Loaded:
- A.mat -- areas of each patch
- Coordinates.mat -- latitude and longitude of each patch
- Preference.mat -- vector of probabilities for each patch
- Populations.mat -- vector of populations of each patch 
- Q_small -- 4x4 matrix of each patch and preferred directions

Expected Output:
 - A graph of the total daily numbers in compartments E,I,R for all 4 patches combined.
 - A graph of the total number of patches affected as a function of the time step (1 day).
