The intial patch can be adjusted, in this example initial_patch=518, with a single exposed individual.
L = 1000 (adjustable time horizon)
NR = 1   (adjustable number of realisations)
M = 592  (adjustable total number of patches)

Adjustable Model Parameters:
avec = [3,8,12]  (vector of possible a values)
bvec = [1,2]     (vector of possible b values)
rhovec=[1/5,1/14](vector of possible rho values)
epsilonvec = [0,0.01,0.05,0.1] (vector of possible epsilon values)
lambdavec = [0.08,0.1] (vector of possible lambda values)
beta = 0.334 (beta contact value.....this is set for R0 = 6)
ss = 6 (size of each household)
f_trade = 0.25 (frequency of movement for trade)
f_ceremony (frequency of movement for ceremony)
nu = sacaling parameter

Capable of looping through above vectors, but this example just fixes these values, reducing the number of loops.

Output files:
All output is saved in binary format to minimize size

518A_Epi_Lengths.bin  - 1D array of epidemic length for each realization
518A_I_Tally.bin - 4D array of total I for each patch at each time step
518A_Total_IPP.bin - 2D array of total I for each patch over full epidemic (I Per Patch)
518A_Unique_E.bin - 1D array of total unique exposed individuals over full epidemic (per patch)
