Readme for Stochastic Disease Model
Created 8 October 2024
Updated 13 March 2025

Main Script to run in Matlab is Full_Model.m.  Spread uses the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (Gillespie)
to simulate exposure events.  An adaptive tau-leaping approximation us used to optimize this process. Within  
Full_Model, choose the intial patch and the number of inital exposures: E0(patch) = number of exposures.

Functions within main script:
- Middle.m -- Primary working file with main time loop...each subsequent file run inside this file.
- Movement.m -- file that simulates movement between neighbouring patches.
- Spread.m -- file that simulates the disease spread through contact within each patch (S->E).
- adaptive_tau.m -- file called from within Spread.m that adaptively chooses optimal tau.
- RecoverDeath.m -- file that simulates the other stages of disese (E->I, I->R).

Data needed to run the main script:
- Population_Estimate.mat -- Projected population vector for each patch (1x592).
- Q_Estimate.mat -- Conditional probability of movement to each neighbouring patch (sum for each patch = 1).  
- Tindale.mat -- Provides area for each patch based on Tindale map (1940).

To run, set initial contition for E0(starting patch {1,...,592}) = number of initial exposed individuals.
