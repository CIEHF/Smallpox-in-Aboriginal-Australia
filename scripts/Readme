Readme for Stochastic Disease Model
Created 8 October 2024

Main Script to run is OneStage.m.  

Functions within main script:
- Movement1Stage.m -- file that simulates movement between neighbouring patches.
- Spread_beta.m -- file that simulates the disease spread through contact within each patch (S->E).
- RecoverDeath.m -- file that simulates the other stages of disese (E->I, I->R).

Data needed to run the main script:
- Populations.mat -- Projected population vector for each patch (1x592).
- Q.mat -- Conditional probability of movement to each neighbouring patch (sum for each patch = 1).  
- Tindale.mat -- Provides area for each patch based on Tindale map (1940).

To run, set initial contition for E0(starting patch {1,...,592}) = number of initial exposed individuals.
